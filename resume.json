He is excellent with customers. He is a tireless advocate for them inside the company and a tactful representative of the company in front of them. His background from running his own company helps him handle difficult customer situations really well. His professional image was untarnished both inside and outside in spite of a failed product launch for a really important customer that he personally managed. \r\n\r\nJim is also a great technical leader. He's hands-on when needed and otherwise comfortable in delegating. I have seen him come up with clever solutions for complex problems many times. He's also very good at building and maintaining relationships.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend Admiral Welch any time and would love to work with him again."
